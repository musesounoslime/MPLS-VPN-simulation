# MPLS-VPN-simulation
Communication Simulation between Head Office and Branches
Run on eNSP, which is similar with Cisco Packet Tracer

1. Design a network topology using eNSP to simulate the communication between head office and branches with MPLS VPN, which has much higher scalability and lower cost than IPsec VPN.
2.	Deploy IS-IS and BGP protocol to implement high-speed, private and safe encrypted communication, which is easy to change the network topology inside companyâ€™s devices.
3.	Used Core/Distribution/Access structure in head office router distribution, implemented redundant configuration and load balancing to maintain high-availability environments and disaster recovery plans.
4.	Installed Access Controllers (AC) and Access Points (AP) to facilitate easy WLAN access for mobile and laptop devices, and allocated every departments with independent VLAN to isolate disturbance from each other.

Steps:
1. Open MPLS VPN.topo at eNSP.
2. Start devices.
3. Test PC1 ping PC7, if ping successfully, system run well.
